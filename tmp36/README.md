# Meassures temperature using TMP36


## Notes

[TMP36 Datasheet](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/TMP35_36_37.pdf)

TMP36 outputs 0.75V at 25째C. Output scale 0.01V/째C. This means that at 0째C the
measured voltage will be 0.5V and a change of 0.01V in the voltage corresponds
to a 1째C temperature change.
